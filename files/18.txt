Ocean acidification is a direct consequence of rising atmospheric CO₂ levels, as seawater absorbs the gas and forms carbonic acid. This process lowers the pH of the oceans, making them less hospitable for calcifying organisms like corals, mollusks, and certain plankton species. The disruption of these foundational species can have cascading effects on marine ecosystems, fisheries, and coastal communities dependent on ocean resources. Coral reef degradation, in particular, threatens biodiversity hotspots and the livelihoods of millions. Scientists are exploring mitigation strategies, including reducing CO₂ emissions, restoring seagrass and mangrove habitats that sequester carbon, and developing selective breeding programs for acidification-resistant species. Yet, without substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, these measures may only slow—not stop—the progression of acidification. Public awareness and policy action remain critical to addressing this often-overlooked facet of climate change.
