In the late 14th century, Europe witnessed a turbulent period marked by political instability, religious conflict, and significant cultural transformation. The Black Death had already swept through much of the continent, decimating populations and altering the socioeconomic structure. Feudal systems began to strain under the weight of depopulation, giving rise to labor shortages and shifts in land ownership. The Catholic Church, a central institution in medieval life, faced challenges to its authority, both from internal corruption and emerging reform movements. This era also saw the dawn of the Renaissance in certain Italian city-states, where patronage of the arts and the revival of classical learning began to take root. Meanwhile, kingdoms such as England and France were embroiled in prolonged wars, most notably the Hundred Years' War, which reshaped borders and national identities. Despite these hardships, the period was not devoid of progress; advancements in architecture, literature, and science began to sow the seeds for profound changes in the centuries to follow.
