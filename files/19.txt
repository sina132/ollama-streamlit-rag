Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to revolutionize education by overlaying digital content onto the physical world, creating immersive learning experiences. In science classes, students can explore 3D models of molecules or dissect virtual organisms without ethical concerns. History lessons can be enriched by bringing historical events and artifacts to life in the classroom. AR also supports vocational training, allowing learners to practice complex tasks in simulated environments before applying them in real-world contexts. The technologyâ€™s accessibility has improved with smartphones and affordable headsets, but challenges include ensuring equitable access, creating high-quality educational content, and preventing cognitive overload from excessive visual stimulation. Research suggests that AR can enhance engagement and retention when integrated thoughtfully into curricula. As educators experiment with these tools, best practices will emerge to maximize learning benefits while minimizing potential distractions.
