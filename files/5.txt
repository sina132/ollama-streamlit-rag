Coastal cities around the world face an increasingly urgent threat from climate change, primarily through sea level rise and extreme weather events. Scientific consensus attributes much of this change to human-driven greenhouse gas emissions, which warm the atmosphere and melt polar ice sheets. Cities like Miami, Jakarta, and Venice are already grappling with chronic flooding, saltwater intrusion, and the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. Adaptation strategies vary: some municipalities invest in sea walls and storm surge barriers, while others explore managed retreatâ€”relocating communities away from high-risk zones. Beyond physical impacts, climate change disrupts local economies, threatens cultural heritage sites, and exacerbates social inequalities, as marginalized communities often lack resources for recovery. Global cooperation is essential, yet political will remains inconsistent, hampered by short-term economic interests and ideological divides. The challenge for the coming decades lies in balancing development with sustainability, ensuring that vulnerable urban areas remain livable in the face of accelerating environmental change.
