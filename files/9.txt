Linguistic diversity is an integral part of humanity’s cultural heritage, yet it faces unprecedented threats. Of the approximately 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, UNESCO estimates that over 40% are endangered. Globalization, urbanization, and the dominance of a few major languages accelerate the decline, often within just a few generations. Language loss erodes unique worldviews, oral traditions, and knowledge systems, including ecological wisdom embedded in indigenous tongues. Efforts to preserve languages range from community-based revitalization programs to digital archiving projects and educational initiatives in bilingual or immersion formats. Technology plays a growing role, with AI-driven translation tools, speech recognition, and virtual reality environments offering new ways to engage learners. However, these tools must be developed in collaboration with native speakers to ensure cultural authenticity and sensitivity. Preserving linguistic diversity is not just about saving words—it is about safeguarding identities and the collective human story.
