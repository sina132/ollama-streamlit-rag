Urban agriculture—growing food within cities—has emerged as a viable strategy to enhance food security, promote sustainability, and strengthen local economies. From rooftop gardens and vertical farms to community allotments, urban agriculture can reduce transportation emissions, make fresh produce more accessible, and foster community engagement. Advances in hydroponics, aeroponics, and LED lighting enable year-round cultivation in spaces previously unsuitable for farming. Cities like Singapore, Detroit, and Havana have demonstrated the transformative potential of integrating agriculture into the urban fabric. However, scaling urban agriculture requires overcoming challenges such as high real estate costs, zoning restrictions, and the need for specialized skills. Moreover, urban farms often struggle to compete with large-scale rural producers on price, making them more viable for high-value crops. Despite these hurdles, urban agriculture offers a pathway to more resilient and self-sufficient cities, especially in the face of global supply chain disruptions and climate change pressures.
